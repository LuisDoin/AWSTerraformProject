# AWS Terraform Project

## Spinning Up The Infrastrucure

After clonning the repository, set up your aws credentials in your credentials file and move to the iac folder 

`cd iac`

Then run the command 

`terraform apply`

After setting up the changes the console will ask for your confirmation. Type

`yes`

## Publishing And Fetching Events

Once the infrastructure is up and running, move to the EventListenerLambda folder

` cd ../EventListenerLambda/src/EventListenerLambda`

and run the command

` aws sns publish --topic-arn <topic-arn> --message file://event.txt`

replacing the <topic-arn> placeholder with the `event-sns` topic arn which can be find in your AWS console. 
This command will publish the event contained in the event.txt file into the event-sns topic. 

Almost instantly the event will be stored in the `event_storage` DynamoDB table. You can also see the logs in the `/aws/lambda/event-listener` CloudWatch log group. After some moments (it can take up to five minutes) the event will be available in the `cko-project-events-bucket` s3 bucket. 
To fetch it locally, run the command 

`aws s3 sync s3://cko-project-events-bucket/events/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD> events`

replacing the placeholders with the current date information. This will create the events folder containing your event information. 

And Voil√†, the event has travelled the world and come back to your machine intact :D
